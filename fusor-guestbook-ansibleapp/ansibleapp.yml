# NOTE: This is a prototype binding consumer and will likely
# change frequently as the format is iterated upon
# Dynamically consumes HOST/PORT from environment based on binding
# key. Ex: binding_key=EXTERNAL_MLAB, guestbook will look for
# EXTERNAL_MLAB_SERVICE_{HOST,PORT} as are provided by the service/endpoint
# assets that were created by an external-mlab-ansibleapp provision.
#
# Secrets are not available yet, but when they are, they will
# also be provided by a pod injection policy. Until a real
# catalog can provide this service, we'll fake it and allow the
# asbcli to provide these parameters.
